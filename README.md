## Notes

Some challenges I encountered when working on this project was the switch in operating system and the confusion of the new IDE/language. Personally,
I have never used a MacOS, especially a virtual machine, so installing and using these two things together provded to be an obstacle at first but with investing
time into learning I was able to understand. The second challenge was trying to understand Swift and Xcode because they are brand new to me but after reading the 
recommended readings and strictly following the instructions I gained some basic knowledge and foundations. The first time I created and coded the project I
encountered a problem with the main that would not allow it to execute and since I lacked the knowledge to correctly troubleshoot I decided to restart. This was
actually a positive process because I recreated the entire project without the directions and it tested my comprehension.
